            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my Website! My name is Shefali, and I am a third-year Behavioral Neuroscience and Data Science major at
                Northeastern University. I am currently on the pre-med track, and hope to work in the fields of neurology, psychiatry,
                pediatrics, or family medicine. This website will outline my experiences and interests related to healthcare and 
                healthcare-related research and volunteering, as well as my other interests.
            <p>

                Aside from research, my interests include staying active by going to the gym, which helps me unwind and maintain a 
                balanced lifestyle. I also have a deep love for painting, using it as a creative outlet to explore different styles 
                and techniques. 
            <p>   
                Spending time with my dog is one of my favorite ways to relax, whether it’s going on long walks or just enjoying quiet 
                moments together. Additionally, I love baking, always looking for new recipes to try—especially when it comes to perfecting 
                desserts to share with family and friends.
            <p>
                I also have a passion for learning new skills, whether it’s embroidery, playing guitar, or picking up a new craft. I love                     the challenge of trying something unfamiliar and the sense of accomplishment that comes with improving over time.
            <p>
                These hobbies allow me to express creativity, stay active, and find joy outside of my professional and academic interests.
