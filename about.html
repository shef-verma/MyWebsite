            <h2>My experience</h2>
            <h3>Research Experience</h3>
            <p>
                Two years ago, I began volunteering at the Boston Children's Hospital's Laboratories of Cognitive Neuroscience in 
                the Wilkinson Lab. My focus has been on the lab’s “Brain indicators of Developmental Growth” study —also called “BRIDGE”
                study—with the goal of understanding how brain activity in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Down Syndrome, and 
                Fragile X Syndrome affect their language acquisition, learning and behavior. My roles within the lab are multifaceted. 
                Clinically, I assist senior research assistants in administering the study's neuro-behavioral assessments, scoring those
                assessments, and providing behavioral support to the participants of the study during the administration of the EEG 
                paradigms. On the technical side, I design solutions to ensure consistency and accuracy in the lab's REDCap database. 
                On the analytical side, I am responsible for taking the collected EEG data from the phoneme paradigm, and hand-editing 
                the data so that it becomes viable for further processing and analysis.
                
            <h3> Clinical Experience</h3>
            <p>   

            <h4> Outpatient Primary Care Medical Assistant (Co-op Experience) </h4>
            <p>   
                 During my previous co-op, I worked as a medical assistant in an outpatient primary care setting, where I gained 
                 experience in direct patient care, administrative responsibilities, and clinical procedures. I managed medication 
                refills, prior authorization requests, and patient records within the EPIC EMR system while also conducting diagnostic 
                tests such as EKGs, covid/flu tests, and urinalyses. Additionally, I assisted providers in minor procedures like Pap 
                smears and IUD insertions, ensured exam rooms were stocked, and trained new medical assistants. This experience strengthened 
                my ability to work in fast-paced clinical environments while providing compassionate and efficient patient care.
                
            <h4> Volunteer Ambassador – VA Hospital </h4>
            <p>
                As a volunteer ambassador at the VA Hospital, I supported veterans navigating the healthcare system, ensuring they 
                received the care and resources they needed. My role involved assisting patients in finding their appointments, providing 
                companionship, and facilitating communication between staff and veterans. This experience exposed me to the unique challenges 
                of geriatric and veteran healthcare, reinforcing my commitment to serving older, and underserved populations.\
                
            <h4> Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) – Northeastern University Sports Events </h4>
            <p>
                As a licensed EMT, I have provided on-site emergency medical care at Northeastern University sports games, 
                ensuring the safety and well-being of athletes and spectators. This role required me to assess and respond to medical 
                emergencies, including traumatic injuries, heat exhaustion, and cardiac events, while coordinating with paramedics and 
                event staff. Working in high-stress, fast-moving environments, I developed strong critical thinking and decision-making 
                skills, further enhancing my ability to provide effective emergency care.

            <h3> Other Volunteer Experience</h3>
            <p>
            <h4> Registration Coordinator – Lexington Food Pantry </h4>
            <p>
                As a Registration Coordinator at the Lexington Food Pantry, I was responsible for overseeing all front-end operations, 
                ensuring that over 215 families received their groceries each week. I managed a team of volunteers, handled client registration, 
                food order distribution, and conflict resolution, and worked to improve overall efficiency in service delivery. A significant 
                aspect of my role involved working with underserved refugee communities, many of whom faced food insecurity, 
                language barriers, and healthcare challenges. I developed a particularly strong connection with refugees housed in 
                a nearby hotel, providing assistance in health-related concerns, translation, and resource navigation. My experiences here 
                deepened my understanding of the social determinants of health, highlighting the intersection between food access, economic 
                stability, and healthcare disparities. Through this role, I strengthened my skills in leadership, cultural competency, and 
                crisis management, reinforcing my passion for working with marginalized communities and advocating for equitable access to 
                essential resources.
